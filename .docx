o	Ensure the necessary debugger extension is installed for your programming language or framework. Many popular languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java have dedicated debugger extensions available in the VS Code Marketplace.
2.	Configure Launch Configuration:
o	Create or modify a launch.json file to configure how VS Code launches and debugs your program. This file specifies the runtime, program entry point, environment variables, and other settings.
o	Access Run > Add Configuration... from the top toolbar in VS Code or manually create/edit launch.json in the .vscode directory of your workspace.
3.	Set Breakpoints:
o	Place breakpoints in your code where you want the debugger to pause execution for inspection.
o	Click in the gutter next to the line numbers or use F9 to toggle breakpoints.
4.	Start Debugging Session:
o	Press F5 or click Run > Start Debugging from the top toolbar to start the debugging session.
o	VS Code will launch your program according to the launch configuration and pause at the first breakpoint encountered.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
1.	Stepping Through Code:
o	Step Over (F10): Executes the current line and moves to the next line.
o	Step Into (F11): Moves into a function call or method to debug its execution.
o	Step Out (Shift+F11): Steps out of the current function or method back to its caller.
2.	Variables and Watch Expressions:
o	Variables View: Shows the current values of variables in the current scope.
o	Watch Expressions: Allows you to monitor the value of specific expressions as you step through the code.
3.	Call Stack:
o	Call Stack View: Displays the function call hierarchy leading to the current execution point.
o	Enables navigation back to previous function calls for deeper inspection.
4.	Debug Console:
o	Debug Console: Provides an interactive console where you can execute arbitrary code and evaluate expressions within the context of your running program.
o	Useful for testing hypotheses and experimenting with code changes on the fly.
5.	Conditional Breakpoints:
o	Set breakpoints with conditions (right-click breakpoint > Edit Breakpoint) to pause execution only when certain conditions are met, enhancing efficiency in complex debugging scenarios.
6.	Exception Handling:
o	Configure how VS Code handles exceptions (right-click breakpoint > Edit Breakpoint) to pause on exceptions or ignore specific exceptions during debugging

10.	Using Source Control:
How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Initializing a Repository
1.	Open VS Code:
o	Launch VS Code and open your project folder or workspace.
2.	Initialize Git Repository:
o	Go to the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar (or use Ctrl+Shift+G).
o	Click on Initialize Repository or Initialize Git Repository Here if it's a new project.
o	Alternatively, open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and use the command:
bash
Copy code
git init
Making Commits
1.	Stage Changes:
o	In the Source Control view, you’ll see a list of changed files. Click the + button next to a file to stage it for commit. Alternatively, stage all changes with Stage All Changes.
o	Or use the terminal:
bash
Copy code
git add .   # Stage all changes
git add <file_name>   # Stage specific file
2.	Commit Changes:
o	Enter a commit message summarizing the changes made.
o	Click the check mark (Commit) in the Source Control view or use Ctrl+Enter.
o	Or use the terminal:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Pushing Changes to GitHub
1.	Linking to GitHub:
o	If not done already, link your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub:
	Go to GitHub and create a new repository if needed.
	Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).
2.	Add Remote Repository:
o	In the terminal or Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), use the command:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_url>
o	Replace <repository_url> with your GitHub repository URL.
3.	Push Changes:
o	Push your committed changes to GitHub:
	In VS Code, use Push button in the Source Control view or use Ctrl+Shift+P and type Git: Push.
	Or use the terminal:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
	Replace master with the branch name if you're using a different branch.
Additional Tips
•	Branching and Merging:
o	Create and switch branches using the Source Control view or terminal (git checkout -b <branch_name>).
o	Merge branches locally (git merge <branch_name>) before pushing changes to GitHub.
•	Pulling Changes:
o	Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository (git pull origin master) to keep your local repository up to date.
•	Handling Conflicts:
o	Resolve merge conflicts if they occur during pulls or merges
